# Contributing to LiveDisplay

Want to contribute to this project? Great, I like to keep it easy so you can just:
* Submit an issue reporting bugs or suggesting new features.
* Submit a fix using PR's.
* Do you know another language that is not localized in the app? Check my CrowdIn <!missinglink> Project to localize the app as much as possible.


## Report bugs using Github's issues.

It's easier.
Report bugs with detailed description and if you can, steps to reproduce them, and everything,
so here I can find a solution as quick as possible, :)

## Pull Requests
* Fork the repo and make changes to the code.
* Test your code and be sure it works.
* Explain what are you trying to do or solve with examples.
* Stick to the current programming style, so I and you avoid to waste time by making changes such as refactorization, for example.


## When coding...

Use good code practices as, make code readable and easy to understand, you can also add comments in the code explaining what it does and why, 
that makes another dev happy in the world ;-)
