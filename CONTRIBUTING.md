# Contributing to LiveDisplay

Want to contribute to this project? Great, I like to keep it easy so you can just:
* Submit an issue.
* Submit a fix, from tiny typos to an app-breaking feature/bug
* Propose new features
* Do you know another language that is not localized in the app? Become a translator!


## Report bugs using Github's issues.

It's easier.
Report bugs with detailed description and if you can, steps to reproduce them, and everything,
so here I can find a solution as quick as possible, :)

## Pull Requests
* Fork the repo and make changes to the code.
* Test your code and be sure it works.

## I want to help coding...

You're more than welcome! Just fork the project and start coding and submitting PR's!
This app is following the Observable pattern so, you must use it too, so we can keep the app maintainable.

## When coding...

Use good code practices, make code readable and easy to understand, you can also add comments in the code explaining what it does and why, 
that makes another dev happy in the world ;-)
